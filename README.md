# Salary Calculator using jquery


## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

The goal of this project was to create a a way to track employee salaries using an input field and a table to store
each input. Additionally, the app was to track total monthly salary against a budget cap, along with providing a 
delete button upon table row generation. Ideally, the delete button would be able to remove not only the line on the
table, but also alter the running monthly total displayed underneath.


## Built With
